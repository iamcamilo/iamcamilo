title: Who is Camilo
---
<p>Nice to meet you! <br><br> My name is <strong>Camilo Muñoz</strong>, I'm a Designer and Front-end Developer who since I discovered the digital world, I immediately fell in love of all the strength that intangible products can have.
<br><br> I’ve been designing and building websites and apps for <strong>over 6 years</strong>, always making decisions based on users’s needs.
<br><br> I’m a bit nerdy, so when I’m not designing or writting code, I may be watching the last chapter of Game of Thrones, or reading a Batman comic.</p>
