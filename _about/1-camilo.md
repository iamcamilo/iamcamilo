My name is **Camilo Muñoz**, I'm a Chilean Designer and Front-end Developer. Since I discovered the digital world, I immediately fell in love with all the strength that intangible products can have.

I’ve been designing/building **websites, apps and brands for over 8 years**, always making decisions tailored to user's needs.

I’m a bit nerd, so when I’m not designing or coding, I may be watching the last episode of Game of Thrones, or reading a Batman comic.
